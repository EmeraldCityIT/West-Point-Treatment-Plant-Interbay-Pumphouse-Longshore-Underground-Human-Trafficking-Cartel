# West-Point-Treatment-Plant-Interbay-Pumphouse-Longshore-Underground-Human-Trafficking-Cartel
The Longshore is a series of underground tunnels that run the length of America. Human trafficking cartels, Freemasons, and corrupt officials use the underground world to traffick humans who have little knowledge of the world above ground or outside of a laboratory. The Westpoint Treatment plant and interbay Pump House are used to house human trafficking victims for sexual slavery and organ harveting. The Interbay Self Storage and Seattle National Guard Armory are part of human trafficking operations in Seattle, WA.
